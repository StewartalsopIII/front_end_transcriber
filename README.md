# Whisper Transcriber

A web application for transcribing audio files with OpenAI's Whisper API, featuring client-side compression and secure backend API processing.

## Features

- üé§ Transcribe audio files using OpenAI's Whisper API
- üìù Get timestamped transcription results
- üîÑ Drag and drop file uploads
- üóúÔ∏è Automatic compression for large files (up to 25MB limit)
- üîí Secure API key handling via serverless functions

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the App Locally

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:5173

### Setting your API Key

For local development, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Deployment to Vercel

This app is ready for secure deployment on Vercel:

1. Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account
2. Create a new project on Vercel and connect to your GitHub repository
3. Set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the Vercel project settings
4. Deploy!

### Vercel Environment Variables

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key (required) |

The application uses Vercel serverless functions to securely process transcription requests, ensuring your API key is never exposed to clients.

## Usage

1. Drag and drop an audio file (M4A, MP3, WAV, OGG) onto the upload area
2. Click the "Transcribe Audio" button
3. Wait for the transcription to complete
4. View the timestamped transcription result

## Compression Features

For large audio files, the app automatically:
- Reduces sample rate (down to 6kHz for voice)
- Converts stereo to mono
- Reduces bit depth (16-bit to 8-bit)
- Applies dynamic range compression
- Uses volume scaling
- Implements advanced sample skipping for extreme cases

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Check if the API key is correctly set in environment variables
3. For API errors, check Vercel function logs
4. For file size errors, the file may still be too large even after compression
